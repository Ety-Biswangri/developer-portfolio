            <h3>A Novice Web Developer</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">I am Ety Biswangri. I have completed my B.Sc. (Hon's) in CSE from BGC Trust
                University.
                Now I am learning Web Development from Programming Hero. I believe that learning is a continuous
                process.
                And I want to see myself as a skilled Web Developer in future.

            <h3>Become a Web Developer</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I
                can even teach my grandma how
                to make simple website. My goal is to build more websites and learn advanced topics.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security.
                    I will give you 100% web solution.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
